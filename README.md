# Bank-Account
It is a project I made for college in Python classes.
The main goal was to made program, with simple GUI, that will allow you to create new bank account

## The assumptions of program was simple: 
- Bank workers should be able to create account for customer (INT - international, PL - Polish or for company)
- Create a account based on class: BankAccount_COVID19, BankAccount_COVID19_Company or BankAccount_INT(if its for international client)
- The program should save account data in a separate file named "account"
- Create GUI using tkinter interface
